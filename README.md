# ⚡️ Real-Time Collaboration System with Socket.IO

## 🧾 Project Overview

A high-performance, scalable real-time collaboration system built with **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **NGINX** for load balancing. Designed for platforms requiring instant communication like social media or team-based applications, it supports **lakhs of concurrent users**, seamless horizontal scaling, and room-based messaging.

## 📦 Description & Features

This system is designed to handle massive concurrent real-time communication by distributing traffic across multiple Socket.IO servers via a load balancer. Users can join collaboration rooms (e.g., posts, chats, live threads), and all updates are delivered instantly to relevant participants.

### 🔧 Key Features:

- Real-time updates using WebSockets via Socket.IO
- Room-based collaboration for isolated group messaging
- Horizontal scaling support with NGINX and sticky sessions
- Automatic reconnections and fault tolerance
- Optimized for low latency and high throughput
- Suitable for social platforms, live chat, comments, or collaborative editing

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – Backend runtime
- **Socket.IO** – Real-time, bi-directional communication
- **NGINX** – Load balancing and reverse proxy with sticky session support
- **Redis** *(optional)* – Shared state across socket servers (for scalability)
- **Docker** *(optional)* – Containerization for service deployment
- **Vite + React** – Frontend (in the corresponding frontend repository)

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Socket.IO

- **WebSocket abstraction**: Automatically falls back to HTTP long polling if WebSockets aren’t supported.
- **Built-in rooms**: Easily group users for broadcasting updates (perfect for chat or collaboration).
- **Event-driven architecture**: Easy to handle custom events (e.g., join, message, disconnect).
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on browsers and native apps alike.
- **Reconnection support**: Handles dropped connections gracefully.
- **Middleware & hooks**: Easy integration with authentication, logging, or analytics.
